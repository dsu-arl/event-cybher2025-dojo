## Challenge Description
I love browsing YeeBay to find deals on lightly used items I didn't know I needed. My friend's mom's cousin's son told me you knew a secret way to get admin permissions on the page, can you help me find it?

## Challenge Steps
1. Navigate to the `/challenge` directory with the command `cd /challenge`
2. Run `./verify`
3. Open the web browser and navigate to `127.0.0.1:5000` by typing it into the URL bar
4. Get admin on YeeBay!
