## Challenge Description
In this challenge, you will learn to run some Linux commands! 
When using the terminal, the main way to interact with your computer is to type commands. 
Instead of clicking buttons, these commands tell your computer what you want to do.

We will focus on two commands for this challenge:
- `ls` - the "list" command allows you to list or view the files in your current folder.
    - usage: type `ls` and press `Enter`
    - This will show all files in your current directory
- `cd` - the "change directory" command allows you to move to a different folder.
    - usage: type `cd new_folder` and press `Enter`
    - replace "new_folder" with the name of the folder/directory you want to navigate to
    - This will move you to the new folder. You should see your terminal prompt change to show the folder you're currently in.

This challenge will require you to run the challenge file - but you don't know the file name this time!
You will need to navigate to the `/challenge` directory, find the file, and run it.

## Challenge Steps
1. Open a terminal in the Desktop
2. Navigate to the `/challenge` directory (Hint: Type `cd /challenge` and press `Enter`)
3. Use the `ls` command to find the challenge file (Hint: it is NOT the DESCRIPTION.md file)
4. To run this challenge, type the filename and press `Enter`!
5. Submit your flag!
