## Challenge Description
This challenge focuses on your ability to follow the program's call structure and identify the final password. You have access to the source code of this python program, so the challenge is not deciphering the output, but understanding the source code.

## How it Works
There are four functions utilized in this program to generate the password. Each function uses some variation of the two lists (```alphabet``` and ```special_char```) to create the password. Attention to detail is the key to solving this challenge! You can run the program to see what the initial word lists look like.

## When You're Done
When you have finished your analysis, follow the steps in the Challenge Steps section below.
