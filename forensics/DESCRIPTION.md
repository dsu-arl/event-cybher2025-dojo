This module teaches you some basic _forensics_ tools and techniques! 
**Digital forensics** is the process of collecting, analyzing, and preserving digital evidence from electronic devices to investigate crimes or security incidents. 
It helps uncover what happened, how, and who was involved.

In this module, you'll be looking for hidden information - usually in the form of a temporary flag that looks like this: `FLAG{...}`. Remember , this is not your official flag! You'll need to run `/challenge/verify`, enter the temporary flag, and then you will find your official `pwn.college{...}` flag.
