## Challenge Description
You’re a detective investigating a mysterious painting, `art.jpg`, created by a secretive artist. Rumor has it they hid a flag in the image’s metadata, the hidden details that describe a file. Use the `exiftool` command to inspect the metadata and uncover the temporary flag (`FLAG{...}`)!

`exiftool` is a command-line tool to view, edit, and remove metadata from files like photos, videos, and PDFs. You can view the metadate like this: `exiftool image.jpg`

## Challenge Steps
The challenge file is located in the `/home/ubuntu/Artists-Clue` directory.

1. Navigate to `/home/ubuntu/Artists-Clue`
2. Use `exiftool` to view the metadata in the `art.jpg` file - search through it to find your temporary `FLAG{...}`
3. Run `/challenge/verify`, enter the temporary `FLAG{...}, and receive your official `pwn.college{...}` flag!
