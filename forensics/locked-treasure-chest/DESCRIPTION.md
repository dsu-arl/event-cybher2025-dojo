You found a digital treasure chest (treasure.zip) hiding a flag. Unzip it to check its contents, but the real secret might be in somewhere within. Use zip to find the flag, which starts with FLAG{.

Remember when unzip a file use this command unzip /challenge/treasure.zip /home/hacker

Hint: Unzip with unzip treasure.zip, but try unzip -h if you need help looking for the correct command operation. The zip -h will display the help pages for more information about other ways to use zip.

The files that you will be working on are in the /challenge directory.
