You found a digital treasure chest (digital_treasure.zip) hiding another zip file. The flag is contained within the (treasure.zip). Unzip it to check its contents, but the real secret might be in the zip fileâ€™s metadata. Use zipinfo to find the flag, which starts with FLAG{.

Remember when unzipping a file use this command unzip /challenge/digital_treasure.zip /home/hacker

Do not unzip the treasure.zip. You will manipulate the metadata of the file and not get the correct flag.

Hint: Unzip with unzip digital_treasure.zip, but try zipinfo -h if you need help looking for the correct command operation. The zipinfo -h will display the help pages for more information about other ways to use zipinfo.

The files that you will be working on are in the /challenge directory.
