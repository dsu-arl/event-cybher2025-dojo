## Challenge Description
Most challenges will have _files_ stored in the `/challenge` directory.
A directory is just a folder that you can store files in. 
The last challenge ran a file automatically when the terminal was opened, but this challenge requires you to run the file yourself. 

You will need to run the `/challenge/solve` file to get the flag.
There are a few different ways to run files, depending on the file type.
For most challenge files, you will simply need to type the name of the file (including the direcory) into the terminal and hit `Enter`. 

## Challenge Steps
1. Start the challenge and open the Desktop
3. Open a terminal
3. Type `/challenge/solve` in the terminal and press `Enter`
4. Submit the flag!
