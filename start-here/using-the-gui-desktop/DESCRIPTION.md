Our first challenge is learning to use the Desktop!
The GUI Desktop is a _virtual machine_ running a Linux operating system. 
After finishing this module, try out the challenges in the Linux module to learn more about how to use it!

## Challenge steps
1. Start the challenge
2. Open the GUI Desktop - either click "Desktop" in the top navigation tab, or "GUI Desktop Workspace" when the blue banner pops up below.
3. Open a terminal inside the Desktop - click the black box at the bottom of the desktop
4. Once the terminal is open, your flag will appear! 
5. Follow the steps given in the terminal to submit your flag. Copy/pasting from the Desktop is a bit tricky!
