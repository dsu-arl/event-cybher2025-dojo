This module walks you through the basics of using pwn.college, running challenges, and capturing flags!
We suggest completing all of the challenges in this module and the Linux module, from there you can skip around to whatever sounds interesting!

A few helpful definitions to get you started:
- `Terminal` - a different way to interact with a computer. Normally, you click buttons and open apps. With the terminal, you type commands directly to the computer. You may also see this referred to as the `command line`.
- `Command` - an instruction that you type to tell the computer to perform a specific task. Like viewing/editing files or running a program.
- `File` - a place to store data on your computer. You likely have experience with Word Documents (text files) or photos (image files).
- `Folder`/`Directory` - both terms are used to describe a group of files stored together. We use folders/directories to organize our filesystem. A given folder can contain many files, and sub-folders within it.
- `Filesystem` - all of the files on your computer.
- `Code` - a set of steps/instructions for the computer to perform, that ultimately completes a task. 
- `Programming language` - all code is written in a specific programming language. Programming languages allow you (the programmer) to communicate directly with the computer. The programs you write can perform many different tasks, such as calculations, data processing, games, etc.
- `Linux` - an operating system. This is how the computer works. You may have experience with a Windows or Mac computer. Linux is very similar to both Windows and Mac, but has a few different features. The terminal you use in VSCode is a Linux terminal. 
- `Virtual Machine` - essentially a fake/pretend computer inside a real computer! Virtual machines (or VMs) allow you to run programs or even different operating systems without needing a second physical computer. In all of these challenges, you will be accessing a VM through the web browser!
