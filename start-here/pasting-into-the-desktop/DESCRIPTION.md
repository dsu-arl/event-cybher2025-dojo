Next, we will learn to paste into the Desktop!
You will need this secret token: `ThisIsYourSuperSecretTokenThatYouNeedToCopyIntoTheDesktop`
Launch a terminal in the desktop for further directions!

Note that the secret token is NOT your flag. Flags will always look like `pwn.college{...}`

## Challenge Steps
1. Start the challenge and open the Desktop
2. Open a terminal and follow the directions
3. Submit your flag! Remember that you'll need to use the clipboard again to copy/paste it :)
