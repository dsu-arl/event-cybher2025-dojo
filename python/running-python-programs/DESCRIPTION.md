## Challenge Description
#### What is Python?
Python is a *programming language*. Humans have different languages like Spanish, German, or English. Computers have languages too! 
A programming language is just the rules (or syntax) of how to write your programs.
All programming languages have different strengths and weaknesses. 
People like Python because it's easy to read and learn. You can use Python to make games, apps, websites, or even control robots!

#### What are Programs?
A program is just a list of steps written in a programming language (like Python) that a computer follows. 
It's like a recipe that tells the computer how to do something — for example, show a message, solve a math problem, or move a character in a game.

#### How Do You Run a Python Program?
First, you write the program in a file — usually ending with `.py` (like `my_program.py`). This `.py` tells the computer and anyone else who looks at this file that it contains python code.

Then, you run the program using Python.

From the terminal, you can type: `python3 my_program.py` 
And that’s it! The computer will follow the steps in your program and show the results.

Note that `python3` tells the computer what language your program is using, and how to interpret it.
You can also replace "my_program.py" with any python file. 

## Challenge Steps
