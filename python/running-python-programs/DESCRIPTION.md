## Challenge Description
#### How Do You Run a Python Program?
First, you write the program in a file â€” usually ending with `.py` (like `my_program.py`). This `.py` tells the computer and anyone else who looks at this file that it contains python code.

Then, you run the program using Python.

From the terminal, you can type: 
```python3 my_program.py```


And press Enter! The computer will follow the steps in your program and show the results.

The `python3` in that command tells the computer what language your program is using, and how to interpret it.
You can replace "my_program.py" with any python file you'd like to run.
